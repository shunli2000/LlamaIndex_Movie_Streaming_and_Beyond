## LlamaIndex in a Broader Movie Streaming Context: More Than Just Recommendations

### 1. Targeted Advertising
In the realm of targeted advertising, streaming platforms are constantly seeking ways to present ads that align with user preferences and viewing habits. LlamaIndex can process vast amounts of user data—including watch history, interaction patterns, and reviews—alongside external advertising data to create hyper-personalized ad experiences.
For instance, a platform could load advertising data such as ad descriptions, target demographics, and user feedback on ads. With LlamaIndex, the platform can intelligently analyze this data and predict which ads are most relevant to a particular user. Here is an example of how LlamaIndex can be set up for this task:

In this example, we will use user preferences (e.g., genres, recent views) and ad descriptions (e.g., target demographics) to serve targeted ads.

#### Sample data 
ad_data.json (Ad descriptions):
```python
[
  {"ad_id": 1, "product": "Movie Trailer: Avengers", "target_genres": ["action", "sci-fi"]},
  {"ad_id": 2, "product": "Movie Trailer: The Notebook", "target_genres": ["drama", "romance"]}
]
```
user_preferences.json (User data):
```python
[
  {"user_id": 12345, "genres": ["action", "drama"], "recent_views": ["Avengers", "Inception"]}
]
```
#### Code
```python
# Load advertising data and user preferences from JSON files
ad_loader = JSONReader().load_data("ad_data.json")
user_loader = JSONReader().load_data("user_preferences.json")

# Build indices for both datasets
ad_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(ad_loader)
user_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(user_loader)

# Create a query engine for ad targeting
user_query_engine = user_index.as_query_engine()
ad_query_engine = ad_index.as_query_engine()

# Query for user-specific ad targeting based on preferences
user_context = user_query_engine.query("What genres does user 12345 prefer?")
ad_response = ad_query_engine.query(f"Select ads for genres: {user_context}")

print(ad_response)  # Expected output: "Movie Trailer: Avengers (Target: action, sci-fi)"
```


### 2. Video Search and Discovery

LlamaIndex also opens up new possibilities for video search within a streaming service. By indexing not only metadata but also transcripts, user reviews, and plot summaries, it offers users a more nuanced and context-aware search experience. Rather than relying on keyword matching, users can perform complex searches in natural language, such as:
"Show me all the movies with a strong female lead from the past five years."
"Find movies similar to ‘Interstellar’ with a focus on space exploration."

Here is an example of how this might work:


#### Sample Data:
movie_metadata.json (Movie descriptions and metadata):
```python
[
  {"title": "Interstellar", "description": "A space exploration film with deep philosophical themes."},
  {"title": "Gravity", "description": "A thriller about astronauts stranded in space."},
  {"title": "The Martian", "description": "An astronaut is left behind on Mars and must survive."}
]
```
#### Code:
```python
# Load movie metadata for video search
movie_loader = JSONReader().load_data("movie_metadata.json")

# Build an index of the movie metadata
movie_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(movie_loader)

# Create a query engine for video search
movie_query_engine = movie_index.as_query_engine()

# Query for movies about space exploration with philosophical themes
response = movie_query_engine.query("Find movies about space exploration with a philosophical twist.")
print(response)
# Expected output: "Interstellar: A space exploration film with deep philosophical themes."
```

### 3. Personalized Playlists and Content Grouping

LlamaIndex’s ability to process diverse datasets makes it an excellent tool for creating personalized playlists or content collections. By integrating user behavior, reviews, social media trends, and even metadata like soundtracks and cinematography styles, LlamaIndex can craft dynamic content suggestions.

#### Sample Data:
user_reviews.json (User sentiment data):
```python
[
  {"movie": "The Pursuit of Happyness", "sentiment": "positive"},
  {"movie": "Forrest Gump", "sentiment": "positive"}
]
```
user_watch_history.json (User watch history):
```python
[
  {"user_id": 12345, "recent_views": ["The Pursuit of Happyness", "Forrest Gump"]}
]
```

#### Code:
```python
# Load user reviews and watch history from JSON files
reviews_loader = JSONReader().load_data("user_reviews.json")
history_loader = JSONReader().load_data("user_watch_history.json")

# Build indices for both datasets
review_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(reviews_loader)
history_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(history_loader)

# Create a query engine for personalized content grouping
history_query_engine = history_index.as_query_engine()
review_query_engine = review_index.as_query_engine()

# Query for uplifting movie suggestions based on reviews and watch history
history_context = history_query_engine.query("What movies has user 12345 watched recently?")
playlist_response = review_query_engine.query(f"Create a playlist of uplifting movies based on: {history_context}")
print(playlist_response)
# Expected output: "The Pursuit of Happyness, Forrest Gump"
```
